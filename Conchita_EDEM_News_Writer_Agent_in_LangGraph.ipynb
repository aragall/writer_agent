[...] Companies that are all in on AI as an ongoing competitive advantage are putting infrastructure in place to speed up the pace of AI models and use-case development. We’re not talking about building big data centers with tens of thousands of GPUs; that’s generally being done by vendors. But companies that use rather than sell AI are creating “AI factories”: combinations of technology platforms, methods, data, and previously developed algorithms that make it fast and easy to build AI systems. [...] Last year, like virtually everyone else, we predicted that agentic AI would be on the rise. Although we acknowledged that the technology was being hyped and had some challenges, we underestimated the degree of both. Agents turned out to be the most-hyped trend since, well, generative AI. GenAI now resides in the Gartner trough of disillusionment, which we predict agents will fall into in 2026.\", \"score\": 0.99915075}, {\"title\": \"What's next in AI: 7 trends to watch in 2026 - Microsoft Source\", \"url\": \"https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/whats-next-in-ai-7-trends-to-watch-in-2026/\", \"content\": \"Software development is exploding, with activity on GitHub reaching new levels in 2025. Each month, developers merged 43 million pull requests — a 23% increase from the prior year in one of the main ways teams propose and review changes to their code. The annual number of commits pushed, which track those changes, jumped 25% year-over-year to 1 billion. The unprecedented pace signals a major shift in the industry as AI becomes increasingly central to how software is built and improved.\\n\\nMario Rodriguez, GitHub’s chief product officer, says that sheer volume is why 2026 will bring a new edge: “repository intelligence.” In plain terms, it means AI that understands not just lines of code but the relationships and history behind them. [...] “We’ll see evidence of AI moving beyond expertise in diagnostics and extending into areas like symptom triage and treatment planning,” King says. “Importantly, progress will start to move from research settings into the real world, with new generative AI products and services available to millions of consumers and patients.”\\n\\nThat shift matters because access to care is a global crisis. The World Health Organization projects a shortage of 11 million health workers by 2030 — a gap that leaves 4.5 billion people without essential health services. [...] ## AI will become central to the research process\\n\\n AI is already speeding up breakthroughs in fields like climate modeling, molecular dynamics and materials design, says Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research. But the next leap is coming. In 2026, AI won’t just summarize papers, answer questions and write reports — it will actively join the process of discovery in physics, chemistry and biology.\\n\\n“AI will generate hypotheses, use tools and apps that control scientific experiments, and collaborate with both human and AI research colleagues,” Lee says.\", \"score\": 0.9991441}, {\"title\": \"The future of AI: trends shaping the next 10 years - IBM\", \"url\": \"https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/artificial-intelligence-future\", \"content\": \"Initiatives such as Llama 3.1, an open source AI model with 400 billion parameters and Mistral Large 2, released for research purposes, illustrate the trend of fostering community collaboration in AI projects while maintaining commercial rights. The growing interest in smaller models has led to the creation of models such as the 11 billion parameter mini GPT 4o-mini, which is fast and cost-effective. It won't be long before there's a model suitable for embedding in devices such as smartphones, especially as the cost continues to decrease. [...] ## How AI continues to develop in the next 10 years\\n\\nBetween now and 2034, AI will become a fixture in many aspects of our personal and business lives. Generative AI models such as GPT-4 have shown immense promise in the short time they've been available for public consumption, but their limitations have also become well known. As a result, the future of AI is being defined by a shift toward both open source large-scale models for experimentation and the development of smaller, more efficient models to spur ease of use and facilitate a lower cost. [...] Imagine starting your day in 2034. A voice-controlled intelligent assistant, connected to every aspect of your life, greets you with your family meal plan for the week, tailored to everyone’s preferences. It will notify you of the current state of your pantry, ordering groceries when necessary. Your commute becomes automatic as your virtual chauffeur navigates the most efficient route to work, adjusting for traffic and weather in real-time.\", \"score\": 0.9986646}, {\"title\": \"The 2025 AI Index Report | Stanford HAI\", \"url\": \"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\", \"content\": \"#### Chapter 1: Research and Development\\n\\nThis chapter explores trends in AI research and development, beginning with an analysis of AI publications, patents, and notable AI systems.\\n\\n#### Chapter 2: Technical Performance\\n\\nThe Technical Performance section of this year’s AI Index provides a comprehensive overview of AI advancements in 2024.\\n\\n#### Chapter 3: Responsible AI\\n\\nArtificial intelligence is now deeply integrated into nearly every aspect of our lives.
